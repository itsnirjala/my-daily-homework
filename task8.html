<hr><li>Twenty years ago, before the digital revolution, businesses had to rely on physical mails and face-to-face meetings to effectively communicate their thoughts. With the widespread use of technology, people can communicate from thousands of miles away from each other. Communication has become faster and easier than ever with e-mails, video conference meetings, and chatting applications.</li><br></hr>
<hr><class="a"># Efficiency Is Improved With Technology</hr>
<hr><li>Using lesser inputs to produce higher output has been the goal of many companies for a long period. Technology enables many industries to achieve this goal with automation. Machines produce output faster than any human being and do not need rest. With the help of machinery, the output produced in months by manual labor can be produced in a few minutes.</li></hr>
