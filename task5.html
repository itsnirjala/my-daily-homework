<p2><u><b># TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY:-</b></u></p2><br>
<p3>a. Artificial intelligence<br>
	     b. information technology<br>
		 c. Space technology<br>
		 d. Entertainment technology<br>
		 e. Operational technology<br>
		 f. Assistive technology<br>
		 g. Communication technology<br></p3>
<p4><b><u>(1.) Artificial intelligence:- </u></b></p4><br>
<p5>Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence process by machine, especially computer system.Artificial intelligence is a field of science concerned with building computers and machines that can reason, learn, and act in such a way that would normally require human intelligence or that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze.</p5><br>

<p6><b><u>2. Information technology:- </u></b></p6><br>
	<p7>Information technology is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve and exchange all kinds of data and information. IT forms part of information and communications technology. Information Technology is a field that manages and processes information for large-scale organizations or companies. Information technology is now synonymous with any form of digital communications and technologies. Everything falls under the grasp of Information Technology, from checking emails to running software on laptops to making a zoom call with colleagues. Even analyzing consumer data or live streaming social media plays a vital role in Information Technology. </p7><br>

		<p9><b><u>Space Technology:-</u></b></p9><br>
		<p10>Space technology is technology for use in outer space, in travel or other activities beyond Earth's atmosphere, for purposes such as spaceflight, space exploration, and Earth observation.The most active topic covering a section of the current affairs under the Science and Technology branch is space technology. The space-age era began with the satellite Sputnik being launched in 1957, and this technology then witnessed progression. Hundreds of satellite data applications were developed, including devices for our daily use to remote sensing, weather forecasting, satellite TV, satellite navigation system, etc. These missions have given us strong, inspiring imagery for mankind, and photographs such as the Blue Marble have become globally perceived symbols of our mother earth.</p10>

		<p11><b><u>Entertainment Technology:-</u></b></p11><br>
			<p12>Entertainment technology is the discipline of using manufactured or created components to enhance or make possible any sort of entertainment experience.
The media and entertainment industry is driven by technology. This includes everything from cutting-edge special effects developed for movies (and then adopted across other industries) to streaming media, virtual reality gaming, and new delivery channels for news, music, and advertising.</p12><br>

<p13><b><u>Operational Technology:-</u><b></p13><br>
<p14>Operational technology is hardware and software that detects or causes a change, through the direct monitoring and/or control of industrial equipment, assets, processes and events.OT, or operational technology, is the practice of using hardware and software to control industrial equipment, and it primarily interacts with the physical world.Examples include industrial control systems, building management systems, fire control systems, and physical access control mechanisms. The hardware, software, and firmware components of a system used to detect or cause changes in physical processes through the direct control and monitoring of physical devices.</p14><br>

	<p15><b><u>Assistive Technology:-</u></b></p15><br>
	<p16>Assistive technology is an umbrella term covering the systems and services related to the delivery of assistive products and services. Assistive products maintain or improve an individual's functioning and independence, thereby promoting their well-being.AT can be low-tech: communication boards made of cardboard or fuzzy felt.
AT can be high-tech: special-purpose computers.
AT can be hardware: prosthetics, mounting systems, and positioning devices.
AT can be computer hardware: special switches, keyboards, and pointing devices.
AT can be computer software: screen readers and communication programs.
AT can be inclusive or specialized learning materials and curriculum aids.
AT can be specialized curricular software.
AT can be much moreâ€”electronic devices, wheelchairs, walkers, braces, educational software, power lifts, pencil holders, eye-gaze and head trackers, and much more.</p16><br>
